Author: Karina - Cafe Delites
<p>Ingredients</p>
<p>• 2 tablespoons (1 oz | 30 g) self raising flour</p>
<p>• 1 tablespoon natural granulated sweetener to keep calorie count low (if white, raw or coconut sugar, and counting your calories, remember to add this in)</p>
<p>• 2 level teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder for a mild chocolate cake OR 1 tablespoon for a darker , richer chocolate cake</p>
<p>• 1/4 teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p>• pinch of salt</p>
<p>• 1 teaspoon reduced fat butter , melted (or coconut oil)</p>
<p>• 2 tablespoons (40ml) unsweetened almond milk (or skim milk for an extra point) *2 1/2 tablespoons of milk if using 1 tablespoon cocoa powder</p>
<p>• 1/8 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</p>
<p>• 3/4 tablespoon mini chocolate chips of choice (milk or dark), divided *optional (See Notes)</p>
</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>1.  Grab a 1/2-cup capacity mug and spray with cooking oil spray. Into the mug, add in the flour, sweetener (or sugar), cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Whisk to combine. To that, add your melted butter, milk and vanilla.
<p>2.  (Optional): Fold in 1/2 tablespoon of chocolate chips. Mix them through. Top with the remaining chocolate chips.
Minute Microwave Method:</p>
<p>1.  Bake in your microwave on 'Quick' or High' setting for 40 seconds. Open the door and gently touch the top with your finger tip. If it's still a little underdone in the middle, bake for another 10 seconds until cooked through (not too long, as the cake will continue cooking in the mug once it's removed).
<h2>Oven Baked Version:</h2>
<p>1.  Preheat oven to 180°C | 350°F. Spray a 1/2-cup capacity ramekin with cooking oil spray. Prepare as above and bake in the oven for around 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean. (For a fudgier cake, check it after 11 minutes with a toothpick and it should come out slightly dirty, but not with a lot of cake batter attached.)</p>
<p>2.  Serve with fruit, icing sugar, ice cream, or whipped cream! Personally, I like this cake on its own.</p>

         <h2>Butternut Squash Noodles</h2>
         <h3>Ever tried Coconut Curry with spiralized Butternut squash noodels?</h3>

        <p1> class="title">Noodles</p1>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        6 tbls coconut milk
<p>6 tsp Thai red curry paste</p>
<p>3 teaspoons fish sauce</p>
<p>1.5 tsp packed light brown sugar</p>
<p>2.25 cups thinly sliced bok choy (about 5 ounces)</p>
<p>3 cups packed spiralized butternut squash noodles</p>
<p>3 tbls toasted unsweetened coconut chips</p>
<p>3 lime wedges</p>
<p>3 cups very hot water, divided</p>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>1.  Add 2 tablespoons coconut milk, 2 teaspoons curry paste, 1 teaspoon fish sauce and ½ teaspoon brown sugar to each of three 1½-pint canning jars. Layer ¾ cup bok choy and 1 cup noodles into each jar. Top each with 1 tablespoon coconut, 1 lime wedge and 1 egg. Cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days.</p>
<p>2.  To prepare each jar: Remove the egg. Squeeze the lime into the jar (discard the wedge). Add 1 cup very hot water, cover and shake until the seasonings are dissolved. Uncover and microwave on High in 1-minute increments until steaming hot, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir well. Cut the egg in half and return it to the jar. Let stand a few minutes before eating.</p>
<p>• To make ahead: Prepare through Step 1. Refrigerate covered jars up to 3 days.</p>
<p>• Equipment: Three 1½-pint wide-mouth canning jars</p>
<p>• Tips: For medium-boiled eggs with jammy-textured yolks, cook in boiling water for 6½ to 7 minutes, then immediately transfer to a bowl of ice water and let stand until cold. For fully cooked hard-boiled, eggs, cook in boiling water for 10 minutes before transferring them to the ice bath.</p>
