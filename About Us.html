<h1> About the Lazyminds </h1>

<h2> The Site </h2>

<p> Our site brings to you all sorts of recipes that you can attempt at in your dorm room kitchen. Yes, we are lifesavers!
</p>

<p>  Jokes apart, here's a bit about us.

<h3> The Founders </h3>

<h4> Fenella </h4>
<p> write about yourself </p>

<h4> Moushita </h4>
<p> Three weeks into Durham and chill and I was already four weeks behind on everything somehow. Plus when the formatives and the summatives flooded me, I had no time to cook and was always hungry. That was when I started making and experimenting with food in mugs-quick and easy!
