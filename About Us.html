<h1> About the Lazyminds </h1>

<h2> Bit About the Page </h2>

<p> Our blog brings to you recipes that you can attempt in your dorm room kitchen. Save time and energy! 
</p>

<p> Just one cup and maybe a spoon- thats all you need to clean up instead of the billions of pots and pans you typically would do.
</p>

<p> As we are thoughtful and want to cater all students, we put up three groups- Vegetarian, Free From and for those who don't really care- Omivorous!

<p>  Jokes apart, here's a bit about us.
</p>

<h3> The Founders </h3>

<h4> Fenella </h4>
<p> write about yourself </p>

<h4> Moushita </h4>
<p> Three weeks into Durham and chill and I was already four weeks behind on everything somehow. Plus when the formatives and the summatives flooded me, I had no time to cook and was always hungry. That was when I started making and experimenting with food in mugs-quick and easy!
